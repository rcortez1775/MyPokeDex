# MyPokeDex

## Technologies

MyPokeDex uses React and Node. The framework Material-UI was used for the front-end design.

## The Why

It had been some time since playing with React and I wanted to create something that really interested me and add my own personal flair to it. I am a big fan of Pokemon and always thought it would be cool to have my own PokeDex in my pocket. So, I went out and made one. 

The idea of the App is a user can store Pokemon in their Pokedex by adding them with a click of the Pokeball. Wow! That's a lot of Poke's in one sentence. 

## The Future 

I look to integrate the PokeApi with my app so when a user enters a pokemon, an image and PokeData will also render within the Pokemon Cards. Gulp! Here we go!
